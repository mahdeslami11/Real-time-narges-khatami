they could not complete with successfully training a final version of
the vocoder before submitting this thesis.
they did manage to get a prototype working
by February, but this model is no longer compatible with changes theyâ€™ve made to the
framework. they are determined to provide a working implementation before the defense
of this thesis, but they cannot report of new experiments for now. Our impressions of the
prototype was that our implementation was successful in creating a TTS model that
could clone most voices, but not some uncommon ones. Some artifacts and background
noise were present due to the poor quality of our synthesizer, which is why hey had
to revise the quality of our data and them preprocessing procedures. One drawback of
the SV2TTS framework is the necessity to train models in sequential order. Once a
new encoder is trained, the synthesizer must be retrained and so must the vocoder.
Waiting for models to train so as to know on what to focus next has been a recurring
situation in the development of them framework.
