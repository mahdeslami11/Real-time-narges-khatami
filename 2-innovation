We developed a framework for real-time voice cloning that had no public implementation. We find the results to be satisfying despite some unnatural prosody, and the
voice cloning ability of the framework to be reasonably good but not on par with methods that make use of more reference speech time. We hope to improve our framework
beyond the scope of this thesis, and possibly to implement some of the newer advances
in the field that were made at the time of writing. We believe that even more powerful
forms of voice cloning will become available in a near future.
